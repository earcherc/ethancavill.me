# My Next.js Portfolio

My portfolio and blog is built with [Next.js 14](https://nextjs.org/), utilizing its new `app/` directory structure for file-based routing and enhanced conventions. It leverages MDX for rich text content, allowing for the inclusion of JSX/React components within markdown files.

## Getting Started
